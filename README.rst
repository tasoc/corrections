This module provides the lightcurve corrections setup for the TESS Asteroseismic Science Operations Center (TASOC).

The code is available through our GitHub organization (https://github.com/tasoc/corrections) and full documentation for this code can be found on https://tasoc.dk/code/.

Installation instructions
=========================
* Start by making sure that you have `Git Large File Storage (LFS) <https://git-lfs.github.com/>`_ installed. You can verify that is installed by running the command:

  >>> git lfs version

* Go to the directory where you want the Python code to be installed and simply download it or clone it via *git* as::

  >>> git clone https://github.com/tasoc/corrections.git .

* All dependencies can be installed using the following command. It is recommended to do this in a dedicated `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ or similar:

  >>> pip install -r requirements.txt

How to run tests
================
You can test your installation by going to the root directory where you cloned the repository and run the command:

>>> pytest

Running the program
===================

.. note::
    The TASOC Corrections Pipeline is based on co-trending of lightcurves and is created with the primary purpose of correcting all lightcurves in a full TESS observing sector. It therefore fundamentally requires a full set of lightcurves, together with the databases generated by the TASOC Photometry pipeline to function.
